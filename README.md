# The Grackle Project

Many experiments will be conducted over the next several years and I post the **reproducible manuscripts** (.Rmd files including text and code) here. Each investigation (a group of hypotheses) has one .Rmd file that goes through different versions:

- **PREREGISTRATION:** I list the hypotheses, predictions, methods, and analysis plan BEFORE any data are collected. 
<br>*Note: the preregistration might already undergo peer review by submitting it to PCI Ecology or as a Registered Report to a journal*

- **PREPRINT:** the version I submit for peer review. 
<br>*Note: if the preregistration has already been peer reviewed, then the preprint is resubmitted to the original peer reviewers for the final review*

- **PUBLISHED:** the final version that is peer-reviewed.

The version is noted in the Commit comment, and the different versions can be seen in the history of the file of interest. Following the version history of ONE file allows one to track how this piece of work has changed through the entire investigation.

Observation versus intervention in casual inference in great-tailed grackles](./g_causal.Rmd). Note: this preregistration is also at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/g5tnh/) because it occurred before the GitHub repository was created. I posted the .Rmd file here at GitHub to implement version tracking. GitHub.
