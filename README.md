The Grackle Project

I am planning many experiments that for the next several years and I will post the reproducible manuscripts (.Rmd files with text and code) for all versions here: preregistration, preprint, and published. 

One preregistration is at the Open Science Framework because it occurred before this repository was created: [Do the more flexible individuals rely more on causal cognition? Observation versus intervention in casual inference in great-tailed grackles](https://osf.io/g5tnh/)
