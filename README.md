# The Grackle Project

Many experiments will be conducted over the next several years and I post the **reproducible manuscripts** (.Rmd files including text and code) here. Each investigation (a group of hypotheses) has one .Rmd file that goes through different versions:

- PREREGISTRATION: I list the hypotheses, predictions, methods, and analysis plan BEFORE any data are collected

- PREPRINT: the version I submit to a journal

- PUBLISHED: the version that is published in a peer-reviewed journal

The version is noted in the Commit comment, and the different versions can be seen in the history of the file of interest. Following the version history of ONE file allows one to track how this piece of work has changed through the entire investigation.

- Logan CJ, Wascher CAF. 2017. [Are the more flexible individuals also better at inhibition?](./g_inhibition.Rmd)

- Logan CJ. 2017. [Is behavioral flexibility manipulatable and, if so, does it improve flexibility and problem solving in a new context?](./g_flexmanip.Rmd)

- Logan CJ. 2017. [Does manipulating behavioral flexibility affect exploration and neophilia?](./g_exploration.Rmd)

- Blaisdell A, Logan CJ. 2017. [Do the more flexible individuals rely more on causal cognition? Observation versus intervention in casual inference in great-tailed grackles](./g_causal.Rmd). Note: this preregistration is also at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/g5tnh/) because it occurred before the GitHub repository was created. I posted the .Rmd file here at GitHub to implement version tracking.
