# The Grackle Project

I am planning many experiments for the next several years and I post the **reproducible manuscripts** (.Rmd files with text and code) here. Each investigation (a group of hypotheses) has one .Rmd file that goes through different versions:

- PREREGISTRATION: I list the hypotheses, predictions, methods, and analysis plan BEFORE any data are collected

- PREPRINT: the version I submit to a journal

- PUBLISHED: the version that is published in a peer-reviewed journal

The version is noted in the Commit comment, and the different versions can be seen in the history of the file of interest. Following the version history of ONE file allows one to track how this piece of work has changed through the entire investigation.

One preregistration is at the Open Science Framework because it occurred before this repository was created: [Do the more flexible individuals rely more on causal cognition? Observation versus intervention in casual inference in great-tailed grackles](https://osf.io/g5tnh/). I also posted the .Rmd file for the OSF preregistration in this repository for ease of use and so that future versions are tracked.
