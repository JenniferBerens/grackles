# The Grackle Project

Many experiments will be conducted over the next several years and I post the **reproducible manuscripts** (.Rmd files including text and code) here. Each investigation (a group of hypotheses) has one .Rmd file that goes through different versions:

- PREREGISTRATION: I list the hypotheses, predictions, methods, and analysis plan BEFORE any data are collected

- PREPRINT: the version I submit to a journal

- PUBLISHED: the version that is published in a peer-reviewed journal

The version is noted in the Commit comment, and the different versions can be seen in the history of the file of interest. Following the version history of ONE file allows one to track how this piece of work has changed through the entire investigation.

Note: this preregistration is also at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/g5tnh/) because it occurred before the GitHub repository was created. I posted the .Rmd file here at GitHub to implement version tracking.
