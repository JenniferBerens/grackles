# The Grackle Project's [PsychoPy2](http://www.psychopy.org) code for touch screen experiments

## Descriptions of what the various files do

 - The **.psyexp files** are the ones to open and run in PsychoPy2
 - The **maestro files** make the food hopper move to the available and unavailable positions
 - The **.xlsx files** contain information that the .psyexp files draw on to run a session (e.g., the position and color of the stimuli on the screen, the inter trial intervals)

Note: we use PsychoPy2 v1.85.2
