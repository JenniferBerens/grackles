The **number of trials to reverse** a preference in the last reversal that individual participated in (an individual is considered to have a preference if it chose the rewarded option at least 17 out of the most recent 20 trials (with a minimum of 8 or 9 correct choices out of 10 on the two most recent sets of 10 trials)). See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](./g_flexmanip.html) for details.,DV,DV,DV,DV,DV,,,
"The **ratio of correct divided by incorrect trials** for the first 40 trials in their final reversal after the individual has seen the newly rewarded option once. These 40 trials include trials where individuals were offered the test and chose not to participate (i.e., make a choice). This accounts for flexibility that can occur when some individuals inhibit their previously rewarded preference (thus exhibiting flexibility because they changed their behavior when circumstances changed), but are not as exploratory as those who have fewer 'no choice' trials. 'No choice' data is data that is otherwise excluded from standard reversal learning analyses. Including 'no choice' trials, controls for individual differences in exploration because those that refuse to choose are not exploring new options, which would allow them to learn the new food location.",DV,DV,DV,DV,DV,,,
"If the number of trials to reverse a preference does not positively correlate with the latency to attempt or solve new loci on the multi-access box (an additional measure of behavioral flexibility), then the **average latency to solve** and the **average latency to attempt** a new option on the multi-access box will be additional dependent variables. See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](./g_flexmanip.html).",DV,DV,DV,DV,DV,,,
"**Flexibility comprehensive**: This measure is currently being developed and is intended be a more accurate representation of all of the choices an individual made, as well as accounting for the degree of uncertainty exhibited by individuals as preferences change. If this measure more effectively represents flexibility (determined using a modeled dataset and not the actual data), we may decide to solely rely on this measure and not use independent variables 1-3. If this ends up being the case, we will modify the code in the analysis plan below to reflect this change before conducting analyses of the data in this preregistration.",DV,DV,DV,DV,DV,,,
