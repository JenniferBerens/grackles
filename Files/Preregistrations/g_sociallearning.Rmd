###ABSTRACT

This is one of many studies planned for our long-term research on the role of behavior and learning in rapid geographic range expansions. **Project background:** Behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change based on learning from previous experience (@mikhalevich_is_2017), is thought to play an important role in a species' ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range (e.g., [@lefebvre1997feeding], [@griffin2014innovation], [@chow2016practice], [@sol2000behavioural], [@sol2002behavioural], [@sol2005big]). However, behavioral flexibility is rarely directly tested at the individual level, thus limiting our ability to determine how it relates to other traits, which limits the power of predictions about a species' ability to adapt behavior to new environments. We use great-tailed grackles (a bird species) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years ([@wehtje2003range], [@peer2011invasion]) (see an overview of the [5-year project timeline](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/README.md)). **This investigation**: The ability to learn individually, or from others, could allow grackles to flexibly change their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. In this piece of the long-term project, we aim to determine what learning mechanisms grackles use (i.e., stimulus or local enhancement, imitation/emulation, personal information) when learning to solve novel foraging problems. We will use two puzzle box apparatuses that contain food accessible via diverse opening methods. Wild grackles will first be habituated to eating from or off of the non-functional apparatus so that differences in neophobia will not confound performance. We will test grackles from a population in the middle of the expanded geographic range to determine whether this species uses social learning. If so, we will then compare performance across three populations (core, middle of the expansion, and at the northern range edge). Results will indicate how social learning might play a role in the geographic range expansion by elucidating how this species solves novel foraging problems in the wild.  

###A. STATE OF THE DATA
This preregistration was written (2017) and submitted to Peer Community in Ecology for pre-study peer review (Jul 2019) prior to collecting any data. 

###B. HYPOTHESES

#### H1: Information about resources is obtained via individual learning and also transmitted socially in the wild.

Prediction 1: Stimulus enhancement will draw attention to WHAT locus on the apparatus to attend to, and then subjects will rely on personal information to learn HOW to solve that locus. This was found for a similar study on New Caledonian crows (@logan2016new). We predict that the grackles will behave in the same way because grackles likely need to pay attention to what resources others are accessing, but the exact details of how to access these resources may not be as important because it is likely that most resources are not very complicated to access (e.g., open a sandwich wrapper to eat the sandwich)

P1 alternative 1: Grackles might rely on local enhancement to attend to a particular area and then rely on personal information to explore the area and learn how to solve a particular locus. Grackles may pay more attention to other grackles when determing whether to visit a location to search for food rather than to what specific food might be present in that location.

P1 alternative 2: Individuals may copy (copy partially suggests emulation, or copy completely suggests imitation) the sequence of actions they observed others using to solve a particular locus. This may be a particularly useful mechanism when trying to open complicated packaging (e.g., a plastic ketchup packet). Complicated packaging is likely not as frequently encountered in the wild because easier to access food such as insects might be more abundant.

P1 alternative 3: Individuals do not use social information, but rely solely on personal information when solving novel apparatus loci. This species does not form strong bonds with each other (relative to, for example, monogamous corvids), therefore perhaps social information is not as important to them when solving new problems.

P2: Dominant individuals will solve faster because they can exclude subordinates from accessing the resource. This might also make it appear that males are faster at solving than females because males are reported as being more dominant than females.

P3: Older individuals may be better at outcompeting others potentially because they have more experience at solving problems in general. We will be able to test this prediction when comparing juveniles (<1yr) and adults (>1yr), but we will not know the age of the adults unless they were banded as juveniles and became adults by the time the testing occurred. Therefore we will have a limited ability to test this prediction. 

P4: It does not require many observations of others attempting to solve or solving at a particular locus to influence which loci observers attempt first. This was found for a similar study on New Caledonian crows (@logan2016new). We predict that it will be the same for the grackles because grackles likely need to attend to fleeting observations of others as they figure out how to find food in their shared environment. Therefore, there is pressure to attend to any available information.

#### H2: Performance on the learning task will vary among grackles in the different populations included in this investigation (core, middle of the expansion, and at the range edge).

P5: Individuals from the population on the edge of the grackle range will solve more options faster and rely more on social learning than grackles from the middle of the expanded range, and the original core of the range. This may occur because social information is particularly useful to individuals in novel environments (e.g., the social learning strategy of "copy when uncertain" [@laland2004social]).

P5 alternative 1: Individuals from the population in the core of the grackle range will solve more options faster and rely more on social information than grackles from the middle and the edge of the expanded range. This may occur because the lack of novelty in the endemic range may result in grackles predominantly using individual learning (i.e., producers) which leads to the production of reliable public social information. When social information is consistently high quality, individuals may be selected to preferentially use available social information to navigate unusual novel situations (e.g. social learning strategy of "copy if rare" @laland2004social).

P5 alternative 2: Individuals from the the middle of the expanded range will solve more options faster and rely more on social information than grackles from the population on the edge of the grackle range, and the original core of the range. This is potentially because population densities might be higher in the middle of the expanded range, therefore there might be more within-species competition for resources such that grackles may be selected to pay increased attention to conspecifics.

P5 alternative 3: There will be no difference in the number of options solved, the speed at which they switch between solving options, and the reliance on personal versus social information on the learning task across grackle populations. This is potentially because grackles in each population are equally social and generalist foragers ([@giraldeau1996social]), measured in a separate preregistration (http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexforaging.html) and rely on a mixture of personal and social information.

#### H3: Repeated assessments of learning mechanisms with two similar apparatuses will illuminate whether performance is consistent within individuals.

P6: Grackles will show repeatable performance on the learning task over sequential trials with two functionally similar but visually distinct apparatuses (@logan2016new, @mccune_2018). This would indicate that behavioral interactions with the task result from inherent learning abilities.

P6 alternative 1: Grackles will not show repeatable learning performance on the two apparatuses. This could happen for several reasons. First, it may indicate that the two apparatuses may vary in difficulty and so performance on one is not predictive of performance on the other. Second, the distinct visual appearance of the two apparatuses could differentially stimulate behavioral responses that lead to variation in performance (i.e., one apparatus has clear plastic doors therefore the food is visible, while the food is not visible in the other apparatus). Third, grackles may learn to solve the second learning apparatus more quickly after having already learned to solve the first apparatus.

###C. METHODS

####**Planned Sample**
	
Great-tailed grackles are caught in the wild in Tempe, Arizona USA and at two additional field sites in future years (core and edge populations) for individual identification (colored leg bands in unique combinations) until as much of the population is banded as possible (58 have been marked in Tempe as of 19 Jul 2019). Some individuals (~6-16) will be brought temporarily into aviaries where demonstrators will be trained on a particular locus of the apparatus before being released back to the wild to serve as demonstrators for the experiment, which will occur in the wild (in the same way as @logan2016new, except in the wild). We will attempt to train grackles in the aviaries on one solving method per bird, per apparatus, for the two visually distinct but functionally similar apparatuses (@logan2016new, @mccune_2018). However, if the solving methods on one apparatus are too difficult for the aviary grackles to learn quickly, then we will only use the easier apparatus for the experiment in the wild and we will not test H3. 

####**Data collection stopping rule**
	
Eight sessions of up to 45 minutes per apparatus type per group will be conducted. A group is defined as having the same trained demonstrator(s) in the presence of many of the same conspecifics across the sessions. For the control group (with no trained demonstrator), the group must have many of the same individuals as in the first session. We will stop this experiment after each group has completed 8 sessions per apparatus or when we must move to the next field site (summer 2020), whichever comes first. At that point, we will analyze the Arizona (middle field site) data to determine whether social learning occured. If not, we will not conduct this test in the other populations. If so, we will conduct this test in the other two populations (core and edge) over the course of one year at each site.

####**Randomization and counterbalancing** 

In the population in the middle of the expanded range, we will attempt to counterbalance demonstrators among the three groups such that each group will observe a demonstrator that was trained in a distinct solving method, and observers in each group will not be exposed to other demonstrators using different opening methods. If we are able to train demonstrators on solving methods for both of the apparatuses, then we will counterbalance which group sees which apparatus type first (counterbalanced order determined at random.org where P=plank apparatus from @logan2016new and L=log apparatus from @mccune_2018. Edge: plank then log; middle: group 1=plank then log, group 2=plank then log, group 3=log then plank; core: log then plank). We will train half of the demonstrators in the core and edge populations (one group per population) on one solving method and the other half of the demonstrators on the other method for each of the two apparatus types. 

####**Blinding of conditions during analysis**

No blinding is involved in this study.

####**Dependent variables**

1) Latency to attempt to solve a particular locus

2) Latency to solve (obtain the food) a particular locus

####**Independent variables**

####*P1-P5*

1) Locus on the apparatus (plank: horizontal side, horizontal flap, vertical flap, or vertical rubber; log: doors A-D)

2) ID

3) Group ID

4) The number of times the naive focal individual observed conspecifics attempting/solving at a particular locus before the focal individual's first interaction at that locus

5) Binary variable indicating whether the focal individual saw another individual succeed (obtain food) or just attempt (did not obtain food) a particular locus before the focal individual's first interaction at that locus

6) The number of successes a focal individual had at other loci before attempting a novel locus (asocial learning)

7) Which apparatus (left or right) was observed or interacted with

8) Sex

9) Age

10) Dominance rank

11) Population (core, middle, edge)

12) Random effect: ID (to allow for multiple events from the same individual)

NOTE: we will run one model per dependent variable per apparatus type (plank or log).

####*P6*

1) Apparatus

2) Sex

3) Age

4) Dominance rank

5) Population (core, middle, edge)

6) Random effect: ID (to partition within individual and between individual variance in performance to calculate an intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC])

###D. ANALYSIS PLAN

We do not plan to **exclude** any data. When **missing data** occur, the existing data for that individual will be included in the analyses for the sessions they participated in. Analyses will be conducted in R (current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam). When there is more than one experimenter collecting data, experimenter will be added as a random effect to account for potential differences between experimenters in conducting the sessions.

####*Data checking*

The data will be checked for overdispersion, underdispersion, zero-inflation, and heteroscedasticity with the DHARMa R package [@Hartig2019dharma] following methods by [Hartig](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html). Additionally, prior to survival analysis we will verify that independent variables to not violate the assumption of proportional hazards [@machin2006survival]. 

####*P1-P5: Learning mechanisms and population differences*

The analysis will be conducted as in @logan2016new with a survival analysis (Cox proportional hazards model), using ID as a random effect, that is sensitive to the order and latency of events at each locus. We will model the rate at which individual *i* in group *j* first attempted method *l* at locus *k* as a function of predictor variables (e.g., age, sex, rank). This method accounts for previous attempts by the subject as well as observations of others attempting and solving the loci.

####*P4: How many observations?*

The analysis will be conducted as in @barrett2017pay using multilevel experience-weighted attraction models that can determine how individuals accumulate experience and the probability of an option being chosen. We will also use this analysis to investigate P1-P5.

####*P6: Repeatability of performance?*

We will only conduct this analysis if we are able to train demonstrator grackles in aviaries on solving methods for both apparatuses. If so, wild grackle groups will receive sequential trials with first one apparatus, then the second apparatus, and we will be able to run the analysis on repeatability of performance.
